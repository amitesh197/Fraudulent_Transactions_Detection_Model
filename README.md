# Fraudulent_Transactions_Detection_Model
This GitHub repository contains the code and analysis for a fraud detection model using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest classifier, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, Gaussian naive Bayes, XGBoost, and hyperparameter tuning. The goal of this project was to develop an effective fraud detection system using different classifiers and evaluate their performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics.

The repository includes the following key components:

1. Data: The dataset used for training and evaluation, which contains transactional data with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

2. Notebooks: Jupyter Notebook files containing the code for preprocessing the data, training the machine learning models, evaluating the models' performance, and generating visualizations.

3. Model Evaluation: Detailed analysis and comparison of the different machine learning models used in the project, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves are provided to assess the models' performance.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques used to optimize the models' performance by tuning the hyperparameters. The notebook includes methods like grid search or randomized search to find the best combination of hyperparameters for each algorithm.

5. Results and Conclusion: A summary of the findings and conclusions drawn from the experiments. It highlights the best-performing algorithm, which, in this case, is k-nearest neighbors, and identifies Gaussian naive Bayes as the least effective model for fraud detection.

6. Documentation: Additional documentation, if available, describing the dataset, the methodologies used, and any relevant information about the project.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for implementing and evaluating fraud detection models using different machine learning algorithms. It provides code, visualizations, and insights that can be used as a reference for similar projects or as a starting point for further research and development in fraud detection.
